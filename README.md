# fetchWlcBackup.sh
Script to order a cisco WLC9800 to generate a backup and send it to a SFTP server

# Word of wisdom
This was made for a WLC9800, considering SFTP upload. This may work with other WLC versions or may need a bit of tweaking.
Also, if you opt for something else than SFTP for upload, you will have to manually edit some lines, but the core of the script should still work fine
